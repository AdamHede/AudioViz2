# AGENTS.md ‚Äì Project Guide for OpenAI Codex

This file provides guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents contributing to this audio visualization tool. The project uses JavaScript (ES6+) and Web APIs, and is in early stages with a single-song visualization MVP, planning to scale into a professional lighting control system.

## üéØ Project Purpose

This project is an audio-reactive visualizer built with JavaScript, Web Audio API, and Canvas. It is designed to evolve into a real-time lighting and visual control system for concerts and festivals. The current MVP loads a single audio file ("Electric Pulse.mp3") and displays synchronized visuals in real time.

## üóÇ Project Structure

- `/src`
  - `main.js` ‚Äî entry point for initializing the app
  - `/audio/` ‚Äî audio decoding, playback, and analysis logic
    - `AudioPlayer.js` ‚Äî manages load/play/pause of audio
    - `AudioAnalyzer.js` ‚Äî real-time FFT & frequency data interface
  - `/render/` ‚Äî rendering logic
    - `VisualizerCanvas.js` ‚Äî draws visuals based on mapped data
    - `SceneConfig.js` ‚Äî defines visual fixture layout & mappings
  - `/core/` ‚Äî controller logic
    - `AppController.js` ‚Äî coordinates audio/render/UI components
  - `/ui/` ‚Äî basic controls (e.g., play/pause buttons)
- `/public/`
  - `Electric Pulse.mp3` ‚Äî test track for manual and automated analysis
- `/tests/`
  - Unit tests (Jest) for all pure functions and audio analysis components

## üßë‚Äçüíª Coding Conventions

- Language: **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- Use **pure functions** where possible for logic (especially in audio ‚Üí visual mapping)
- Code should be **modular** and avoid large monolithic files
- Prefer **dependency injection** for config/state
- Naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for classes and components (`VisualizerCanvas`)
  - camelCase for functions and variables (`mapFftToVisuals`)
- Each function or method must include a short comment for non-obvious logic
- Files should be ‚â§ 200 LOC if possible

---

## üß™ Testing Protocols

OpenAI Codex should follow a test-first or test-parallel approach for new code.

### Test Framework: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

### Test Requirements:

- All logic-heavy modules (e.g., `AudioAnalyzer`, `mapFftToVisuals`) must include unit tests
- Audio test data should be deterministic ‚Äî e.g., fixed FFT input arrays or sine wave generation
- Use `/public/Electric Pulse.mp3` for integration-level analysis consistency
- Prefer mock-based tests for `AudioContext`, `AnalyserNode`, and `CanvasRenderingContext2D`

### Run Commands:

```bash
npm test              # run all tests
npm test -- --watch   # watch mode for development
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Testing Notes for AI Agents:

**Jest Installation**: Jest is installed as a dev dependency and should NOT be run directly. Always use:
- ‚úÖ `npm test` (recommended)
- ‚úÖ `npx jest` (if you need specific jest options)
- ‚ùå `jest` (will fail with "jest: not found")

**Common Issue**: If you see "sh: 1: jest: not found", it means you're trying to run `jest` directly instead of through npm scripts. Jest is not globally installed (which is correct for this project).

**Dependencies**: Make sure `npm install` has been run to install all dev dependencies including jest.
